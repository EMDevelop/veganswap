# Vegan Swap

My goal of this project is to make it easier for people to use vegan alternatives to the meals and products they love.

You can enter a product

This is a PERN application, so a full stack application using ReactJS, Nodejs/expresjs, and linking up to a Postgres database.

The goal of the project is to allow users to find Vegan alternatives to common ingredients (and/or) recipes they're using, to make it easier for people to cook vegan themselves.

I'm hoping to create a community where people add recipes / ingredients and interact with content that others are adding.

It will be free to use, and more than anything I hope it is useful.
