# Vegan Swap

www.veganswap.co.uk

So far this is an MVP, I have a number of features I'd really like to add after I receive some feedback from potential users.

My goal of this project is to make it easier for people to use vegan alternatives to the meals and products they love.

I am hoping to bring together a community of Vegan, Vegitarian and any other interested contributors, and work together to add alternatives using the apps "Add" functionality.
