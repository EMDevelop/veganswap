# Vegan Swap

My goal of this project is to make it easier for people to use vegan alternatives to the meals and products they love.

I am hoping to bring together a community of Vegan, Vegitarian and any other interested contributors, and work together to add alternatives using the apps "Add" functionality.

It's an MVP now, a few more changes and I'll host it to get some feedback from the community.
